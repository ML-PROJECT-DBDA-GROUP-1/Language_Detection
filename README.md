# Language Identification using NLP
Welcome to our Language Identification using NLP project! This tool helps you identify the language of a given text. Whether you have a snippet from a document or a mysterious message, our model can give you insights into the language it's written in.

## Overview

This project focuses on language identification using machine learning techniques. Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, it includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Multinomial Naive Bayes models. The goal is to accurately identify the language of given text data, providing insights into language distribution and enabling language-specific text processing.
